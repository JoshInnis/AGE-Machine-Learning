# AGE-Machine-Learning

This is a experiment to see how much machine learning algorithms that can be written in SQL and Cypher with no access to the Postgres or AGE internals.

Requires one of the [VLE patches in Slack](https://agensgraphsupport.slack.com/files/UVDCYSHNY/F02K1FCNH4P/0001-draft-fix-bug-for-vle-in-path.patch)

A project that uses Incubating Apache AGE to implment machine learning algorithms
